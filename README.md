# Text-Splitter

This Python script allows you to split a text file (.txt, .log, ..) in N partitions.
A useful way to take advantage of this script is to overtake the 100MB GitHub limit,
in this way you can create a folder with all logs/text files splitted on github without
the Large File GitHub limit

# How To
  in order to make this work, run in the shell:
  
  ```
  python3.X textsplitter.py
  ```

  you can check your python version by running:
  
   
    python3 -V
    

  if this is not working means that you are running python 2.X (or you have not python installed on your device)
 

#  Dependencies
    Python 3.x

# To-Do
  - Add Size-Based partitions option
  - Add progress percentage
